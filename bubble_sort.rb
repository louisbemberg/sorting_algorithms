# Bubble Sort
# Probably the worst sorting algorithm ever
# 1. take the first element of an array, and compare it to the next.
# 2. if the element is bigger than the next, swap them.
# 3. If not, don't swap, and instead keep going with the bigger element.
# 4. Once you reach the end of the array, restart.
# 5. If no changes were made during steps 2-4, the sorting is done.
